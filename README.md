1. `handle connection` takes a mutable reference to a TCP stream. It sets up a buffered reader to read from the stream, reads lines from it until an empty line is encountered (indicating the end of the HTTP request headers), and collects these lines into a vector. Finally, it prints out the collected HTTP request. Essentially, it's a basic HTTP request parser for a server.
2. In the updated `handle_connection` method, we've discovered a crucial detail about how the server handles the `Content-Length` header. This header is adjusted based on the length of the response file content, particularly the content of `hello.html`. By employing `fs::read_to_string()`, the file's content is converted into a string, and its length is determined using the len() function. This adjustment ensures that the server accurately communicates the size of the response to the browser. If there are any issues reading the file, the program execution is halted. This approach ensures that when the program runs, it effectively retrieves, renders, and sends the content of `hello.html` as a response.
